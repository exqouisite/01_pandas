# 01_pandas

Hey! This is one of my first Jupyter projects. I made the code in Google Colab; I put the dataset in my Google Drive, then I mount it on my code.

### What I did:
- Data cleaning & inspection
- Basic descriptive statistics
- Data visualization (scatter plots, histograms, 3d visualization, etc)
- Small insights about the dataset

### The Tools I Used:
- Python 
- Pandas

Surely, I'm a begginner in data science field, so feedbacks are always welcome! Thank you :).
